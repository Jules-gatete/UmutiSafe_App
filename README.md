# 🌿 **UmutiSafe – Medicine Disposal & CHW Integration Platform**

**UmutiSafe** is an AI-powered web platform that helps households in Rwanda safely dispose of unused or expired medicines while connecting them with **Community Health Workers (CHWs)**.
It combines **machine learning classification**, **OCR analysis**, and **interactive dashboards** to ensure safe, ethical, and traceable medicine disposal.

## 🔗 **API Integration**

| Function            | Endpoint                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Medicine prediction | `POST /api/predict/text` / `POST /api/predict/image` |
| Disposal records    | `GET /api/disposals` / `POST /api/disposals`         |
| CHW pickups         | `GET /api/pickups` / `POST /api/pickups`             |
| Admin stats         | `GET /api/admin/stats`                               |
| Reports export      | `POST /api/admin/reports/export`                     |

🧠 **AI Models:** Integrated with the [UmutiSafe AI Models API](https://github.com/umutisafe/ai-models) for OCR extraction and disposal category prediction.
Mock APIs in `src/utils/apiMocks.js` can be switched to real endpoints for deployment.

---

## 🧠 **AI & OCR Integration Overview**

* **OCR Pipeline:** Extracts text from medicine labels using Vision-OCR on Colab.
* **AI Classifier:** Categorizes medicines into **five disposal classes** (Recyclable, Hazardous, Expired, Non-returnable, Controlled).
* **Data Flow:** OCR → JSON output → Classification Model → Risk & Disposal Recommendation.

This ensures **end-to-end automation** with minimal manual intervention and high confidence scoring.

---

## 📊 **Security & Ethics**

* ✅ Bias monitoring and explainable AI for fairness
* ✅ Role-based access control (Admin, CHW, Household)
* ✅ HTTPS + input validation for data safety
* ✅ Ethical retention of expired medicine data for traceability

---

## 💡 **Future Enhancements**

* Push notifications for CHW pickup updates
* Real-time CHW location tracking (map integration)
* Multi-language support (Kinyarwanda, English, French)
* SMS/USSD access for non-smartphone users
* Offline mode with caching and service workers
* Barcode scanning and appointment scheduling

---

## 🤝 **Contributing**
